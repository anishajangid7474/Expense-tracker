## Expense-Tracker
 This System divides the Income based on daily expenses.

 ## How to use?
 If you want to use this then you need to add current balance in your account and then you can start adding new transaction. Transaction can be in negative or positive number where negative represent `expense` and positive `income`. Thanks üôè

 ## Example Data
 * Recived salary = 50000
 * bought phone = -10000
 * bought watch = -1000
 * eat a burger = -500
 
 Total income = 50000, Total expense = 11500 and Current Balance = 38500
